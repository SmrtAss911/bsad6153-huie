# ingest/

Code that moves data from your API into your database. You build it with your AI agent, one piece per week:

| Week | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `fetch.py` | Calls your API: authentication, pagination, rate limits, retries. Saves raw JSON to `data/raw/`. |
| 2 | `load.py` | Turns the raw JSON into rows in your tables, using parameterized queries. Running it twice must not create duplicates. |
| 3 | `sync.py` | Combines fetch and load into one incremental, idempotent sync that GitHub Actions runs on a schedule and records in `sync_runs`. |

Only the sync connects as the database owner (`DATABASE_URL`). Everything else uses a limited role.
